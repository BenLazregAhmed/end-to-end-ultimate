## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following installed on your machine:
-   **Docker Engine** (version 20.10+): For containerizing applications.
-   **Docker Compose** (version 2.0+): For orchestrating multi-container Docker applications.
-   **Terraform CLI** (version 1.0+): For provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure.
-   **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 21 or higher): Required for local development of the Spring Boot backend.
-   **Apache Maven** (version 3.6+): For building the Spring Boot application locally.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenLazregAhmed/end-to-end-ultimate.git
    cd end-to-end-ultimate
    ```

2.  **Environment setup**
    If your `compose.yml` or services rely on specific environment variables, you may need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project.
    ```bash
    # Example: Create and populate a .env file if needed
    # cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your specific values, e.g.:
    # DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
    ```

3.  **Start the application stack (Docker Compose)**
    This command will build the Docker images for all services (including the Spring Boot backend and PostgreSQL database) and start them in detached mode.
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```
    You can check the status of your running services with `docker compose ps`.

4.  **Access the Backend API**
    The Spring Boot application (backend service) will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port defined in your `compose.yml` for the backend service).

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Docker Compose
The `compose.yml` file defines how the multi-service application stack is composed and run. It includes:
-   **`spring-end-to-end` service**: Configures the Spring Boot application's Docker image, build context, port mappings, and dependencies.
-   **`database` service**: Sets up a PostgreSQL database instance, including image, port, volume, and environment variables for credentials.
-   **Networks and Volumes**: Defines how services communicate and persist data.

### Terraform
The `terraform/` directory holds the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
-   `main.tf`: Contains the primary resource definitions, such as network configurations (VPC, subnets), database instances, and compute resources (VMs or containers).
-   `variables.tf`: Declares customizable input parameters for your infrastructure, allowing for flexible deployment across environments.
-   `outputs.tf`: Exports important information about the provisioned infrastructure, such as public IP addresses, DNS names, or connection strings.

### Spring Boot
The `spring-end-to-end` service leverages standard Spring Boot configuration mechanisms:
-   `application.properties` or `application.yml`: Located in `spring-end-to-end/src/main/resources`, these files manage application-specific settings like database connection details, server ports, logging levels, and custom properties.
-   **Environment Variables**: Configuration values can also be provided via environment variables, which can override properties defined in the application configuration files.

## 🔧 Development

### Backend (Spring Boot)
To develop or debug the Spring Boot application locally without running the entire Docker Compose stack:

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spring-end-to-end
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The application will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Database Access
When the Docker Compose stack is running, you can connect to the PostgreSQL database from your host machine using a database client. The connection details (host, port, user, password) are defined in `compose.yml` or your `.env` file. The default PostgreSQL port is `5432`.

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Spring Boot Tests
To execute the unit and integration tests for the Spring Boot application:

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd spring-end-to-end
    ```

2.  **Run all tests using Maven:**
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

### Infrastructure Tests (Terraform)
While direct unit testing of Terraform `.tf` files is less common, integration testing of deployed infrastructure can be performed using specialized tools (e.g., Terratest) or by manually verifying resource states and configurations after `terraform apply`.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is structured for flexible deployment, utilizing Docker for application containerization and Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

### Local Deployment
For local development and testing, use Docker Compose:
```bash

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Stop and remove all services
docker compose down
```

### Cloud Deployment (Terraform)
The `terraform/` directory contains the configurations to provision and manage cloud resources for your application.

1.  **Navigate to the Terraform directory:**
    ```bash
    cd terraform
    ```

2.  **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
    This command downloads necessary provider plugins.

3.  **Review the execution plan:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
    This shows you what infrastructure changes Terraform will make.

4.  **Apply the infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
    Confirm with `yes` when prompted.
    *Ensure your cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) are correctly configured for Terraform to use.*

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
The `.github/workflows/` directory is prepared for GitHub Actions. You can define workflows here to automate:
-   Building Docker images.
-   Running tests.
-   Pushing images to a container registry.
-   Triggering Terraform deployments.

## 📚 API Reference

### Backend Endpoints
The Spring Boot application (`spring-end-to-end`) is designed to expose RESTful API endpoints. For detailed information about available endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods, please refer to the backend source code (`spring-end-to-end/src/main/java/...`). If a documentation tool like Swagger/OpenAPI is integrated into the Spring Boot application, its documentation will be accessible at a specific endpoint (e.g., `/swagger-ui.html`).
